    <h2>Note Section</h2>
    <p>There are three ways to applied CSS styling:
      <ol>
        <li>Inline style</li>
        <li>Internal style</li>
        <li>External style</li>
      </ol>
      There are no difference between internal and external styling, its just selecting where comes first to be applied to HTML. However, inline style will be the last to applied to its HTML element, if internal and external exist.

    <p>We called syntax in css as rule. CSS Rule.</p>
